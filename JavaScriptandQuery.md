#**writing a script for a webpage**

1. HOW HTML, CSS,& JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

* <html>

CONTENT LAYER
. html files

* {css}

PRESENTATION LAYER
. css files

* java script()

BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files 

**#PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT**

*three layers form the basis of a popular
approach to building web pages called
progressive enhancement.*

1. HTML ONLY 
2. HTML+CSS
3. HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT

**#CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT**

1. Create a folder to put the
files in it , then start
up your favorite code editor 

2. A JavaScript file is just a
text file (like HTML and CSS
files are) but it has a . j s file
extension, so save this file with
the name example. j s

3. LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT
FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE  

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Constructive &amp; Co.</ title>
<link rel ="stylesheet" href="css/ cOl.css" />
</ head>
<body>
<hl>Constructive &amp ; Co. </ hl>
<script src="js/ add-content.js"></ script>
<p>For all orders and i nquiries please cal l
<em>SSS-3344</ em></ p>
</ body>
</html> 

4. Open the HTML file in your
browser



**# basic javascript instructions**

1. STATEMENTS : A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

2. JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE  : it means Ahmad is not equal ahmad 

3. STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE : Each one should start on a
new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your
code easier to read and follow.

*The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter
when a step is over, indicating that it should move
to the next step*

4. STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS 

**#COMMENTS**
1. explain what your code does.
2. They help make your code easier to read and understand.
3. This can help you and others who read your code. 

**#WHAT IS A VARIABLE?**
it's holder of the value that might changed 

to declare the variable : 
var username;
**var** : variable keyword 
**username** : variable name 



**#DATA TYPES**

1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE >>>>>> ( 4,5,5.7 )
2. STRING DATA TYPE >>>>>> ('bana','54')
3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE >>>>>>(true,false)



**#RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES**
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number

2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words

4. All variables are case sensitive,

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. 

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case
