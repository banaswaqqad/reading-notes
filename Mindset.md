# **Mindset** 
what do you know about Mindset ?

There are two different types of mindset:

1. people with a fixed mindset believe that these qualities are inborn, fixed, and unchangeable.
2. those with a growth mindset, on the other hand, believe that these abilities can be developed and strengthened by way of commitment and hard work.

**Fixed Mindsets**
  * Children who are taught that they should look smart instead of loving learning tend to develop a fixed mindset.
  * They become more concerned with how they are being judged and fear that they might not live up to expectations.


**Growth Mindsets**
 * Kids who are taught to explore, embrace new experiences, and enjoy challenges are more likely to develop a growth mindset.
 * Rather than seeing mistakes as setbacks, they are willing to try new things and make errors all in the name of learning and achieving their potential.

**What Is Your Mindset?**

Do you have a fixed or growth mindset? To find out, start by reading the following statements and decide which ones you agree with most:

1. People have a certain amount of intelligence, and there isn't any way to change it.
2. No matter who you are, there isn't much you can do to improve your basic abilities and personality.
3. People are capable of changing who they are.
4. You can learn new things and improve your intelligence.
5. People either have particular talents, or they don't. You can't just acquire talent for things like music, writing, art, or athletics.
6. Studying, working hard, and practicing new skills are all ways to develop new talents and abilities.

**If you tend to agree with statements 1, 2, and 5, then you probably have a more fixed mindset. If you agree with statements 3, and 4, 6, however, then you probably tend to have a growth mindset.**

# Can You Change Your Mindset?

While people with a fixed mindset might not agree, Dweck suggests that people are capable of changing their mindsets. Parents can also take steps to ensure that their children develop growth mindsets, often through praising efforts rather than focusing solely on results.
**For example**, instead of telling a child that he is "so smart," a parent might commend the child for their hard work on a project and describe what they like the most about the child's efforts ("I really like how you chose the colors for that picture!").
By focusing on the process rather than the outcome, adults can help kids understand that their efforts, hard work, and dedication can lead to change, learning, and growth both now and in the future.

 **Hereâ€™s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:**
