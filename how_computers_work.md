**# how do computers work**



   **2. how inforimation represented inside computers using electricity**
   **3. how computer using circuits to to things from simple math to simulating the world**
   **4. the 4 parts of computer (input / output ) the info**
   **5. what code is and how software control hardware**

   4 things make a computer computer : 

   1. take inpute 
   2. store info 
   3. process the info 
   4. get the output 


   The history of computer : 
   it was made wood and metal by 20 century start using electracl machine but it was very larg and slow and only manipulate numbers now we can play on it ,talk to other 

   *modern computer still contain the same things :
   (input,storing,processing,output)

   
   1. input : the things that you tell to computer what to do by using (mic,keyboard,mouse)
   2. storage : input gives the computer all these data to store it in memory 
   3. processing : computer processor take info from memory , the processor manipulate info using algorithem(series of commands)
   then send the processed info back to store it again in memory 
   4. how the computer gives the output depends on what it designed to do 


**# The binary number system**
only 2 numbers (0,1 )with these two digits we can countup to any numbers

in decimal each number has a positin and we multiply by (10) in binary also each number has a positin but we multiply by (2)

any numbers can represet in (0,1) or wires (on/of) the more wires you use the larger numbers you can store 

**about text,image,sounds it's also represented by numbers**

1. text : assign number to letters , represnt the paragrap as a sequence of number 
2. images : made of tiny dotes callde pixels and each pixel have a color each color can be represented with numbers 
3. sound : series of viberations , viberation represetn as waveform any point in this waveform can represnt by number ,more bits mean higher range of number (more quality sound)

**binary numbers is the backbone how computer input,store,process,output)**
