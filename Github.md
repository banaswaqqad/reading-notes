**#Github**

## GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers,it's give me the ability to access my data anywhere. 

GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, 'but it charges for private' repositories, offering various paid plans.

Each public or private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history. 

*Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.*
