Operators and Loops
##  Comparison operators 

Equal (==)    Returns true if the operands are equal.    

Not equal (!=)    Returns true if the operands are not equal.    

Strict equal (===)    Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. See also Object.is and sameness in JS.

Strict not equal (!==)    Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.    

Greater than (>)    Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

Greater than or equal (>=)    Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.    

Less than (<)    Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.    

Less than or equal (<=)    Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

loops in javascript
loops check check a condition if its true they execute the codes in thier scope over and over until the condition is not met anymore, “false”.

three types of loops
For loops: we use them when know exactly how many times we need to run the statement
while loops: we dont know how many times to run, but we know that we should stop when a certain event happens
do while: same as while except that it will run atleast one time if the condition is false
 

 for loop uses a counter as a condetion . 
 
 Here are three points to consider when you are working with loops :
 * KEYWORDS :
You will commonly see these
two keywords used with loops 

* break :
This keyword causes the
termination of the loop and tells
the interpreter to go onto the
next statement of code outside
of the loop. (You may also see it
used in functions.)

* continue : 
This keyword te lls the interpreter
to continue with the current
iteration, and then check the
condition again. (If it is true, the
code runs again.)
