**# short brief About my self**



## hi every one ! **bana is here**, _i'm gonna be 25 after two months_, i grew up in amman,i studied computer science in philadelphia university. 

As soon as I finished my university education,I started my hard journey in looking for work in order to build my future, I never expected it to be that hard .

 also i didn't know that new graduates should have experience at least in one field of work of which I didn't  have any , I therefore, went for training courses in programming android courses,mobile application development using reactnative language.
 
 
I always thought that what matters was  the number of courses attended  then I realised that what matters was the concentration and hard work in one field; that has changed my perception of intelligence;I began to realise that people are not born intelligent but it's rather the challenges and difficulties they face.
I may have not completely changed but it's my view of things 
My beliefs have changed from I surrender to I shall try once again and form this is very difficult to no pain no gain
