  **#The Evolution of HTML**
1. HTML4


Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).

*some browsers not supporting certain features*


Although HTML 4 had some
presentational elements to
control the appearance of pages
Examples
* include the <center>element
for centering content on a
page
 
* <font> for controlling
the appearance of text

 * <strike> "to put a line through
the text" 

2. XHTML1.0

XML
was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write
new markup languages. Since
HTML was the most widely used
markup language around, it was
decided that HTML 4 should be
reformulated to follow the rules
of XML and it was renamed
XHTMl 


This meant that
there is some new,
more strict rules about writing
markup. For example:
* Every element needed a
closing tag (except for empty
elements such as <img />).

*  Attribute names had to be in
lowercase.

* All attributes required a value,
and all values were to be
placed in double quotes.
*  Deprecated elements should
no longer be used.
*  Every element that was
opened inside another
element should be closed
inside that same element.


3. HTML5 

In HTML5, web page authors do
not need to close all tags, and
new elements and attributes will
be introduced. At the time of
writing, the HTML5 specification
had not been completed, but
the major browser makers had
started to implement many of
the new features, and web page
authors were rapidly adopting
the new markup.
Despite the fact that HTML5
is not yet completed, you can
safely take advantage of the
new features of the language as
long as you endeavour to ensure
that users with older browsers
will be able to view your pages
(even though some of the extra
features will not be visible to
them).


**#Doctypes :**
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included)

**#Comments in Html**

**#Block Elements**
Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window

**#Inline Elements**
Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements

**#Grouping Text &
Elements In a Block**

<div>

in one block

**#Grouping Text &
Elements Inline**

applied to elements that
have specific values for these

to know to use it:


1. src.
The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the
frame.

2. height
The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.

3. width

site.
