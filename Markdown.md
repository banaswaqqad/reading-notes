**# Markdown** 

'Markdown'is a way to write content for the web.
 It’s written in what people like to call “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing.
 Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, **like**:

 *  asterisks ( * ) 
 * and backticks ( ` ).
